# Modified-Insertion-Sort  

Sorting is amongst the most common and the most important operations performed in computer applications. Sorting helps to organise the data so that search operations can be performed faster through search techniques ( such as binary search, interpolation search ,Fibonacci search,etc) . There are many sorting algorithms and their sorting techniques have different complexities. Also, each sort has different performance with different data size. Theoretical and practical performance of sorts tend to differ too. Under all these circumstances, the study of sorting algorithm becomes essential.


In this project, we investigate the performance of four sorting techniques, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort and a modified version of insertion sort and compare their performances.


The results of the project would contribute immensely to designing better performing sorting algorithms, which in turn, would make searching on the data faster.
